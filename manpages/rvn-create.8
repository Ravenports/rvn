.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create packages from Ravenports builds.
This command is not normally invoked by users, but rather the ravenadm tool
of Ravenports calls it to assemble its packages.
.Pp
Packages thus created can be distributed and subsequently installed on
other machines using the
.Cm rvn add
command.
.Pp
The package files are always created with the .rvn extension.
If the
.Ar pkg-name
doesn't end with .rvn, the extension will automatically be added.
.Pp
If the
.Ar pkg-name
is not given at all, the name will be generated from the namebase,
subpackage, and variant values provided in the metadata.  If any of those
three are missing
.Nm
will emit an error.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Fl m Ar metadata , Cm --metadata Ar metadata
Provide all of the package metadata with the
.Ar metadata
file.
This file must be in a format readable by the UCL
library (ucl, json, yaml, nginx).
See
.Sx "METADATA FORMAT"
for details on the supported fields of this file.
.It Fl o Ar outdir , Cm --out-dir Ar outdir
Set
.Ar outdir
as the output directory.
If this option is not given, all created packages will
be saved in the current directory.
.It Fl p Ar prefix , Cm --prefix Ar prefix
The
.Ar prefix
is written into the generated metadata of the package.
It is also used in conjunction with the relative paths
of the
.Ar whitelist
file for the generated package manifest.
.It Fl q , Cm --quiet
Force quiet output.
This is the default, unless
.Cm CREATE_VERBOSE
is set to
.Ar yes
in
.Pa rvn.conf .
.It Fl r Ar rootdir , Cm --root-dir Ar rootdir
.Ar rootdir
specifies the top-level directory to be treated as the root of the
filesystem hierarchy containing the package files.
File paths in generated packages will be relative to
.Ar rootdir .
This allows a package to be generated from content offset from its
intended final location, which allows a package building without
disturbing similar content already on the system.
If unspecified, the default is effectively
.Pa / ,
the actual root directory.
.It Fl t Ar timestamp , Cm --timestamp Ar timestamp
Set the timestamp of the files within the archive.
.It Fl v , Cm --verbose
Force verbose output, the opposite of
.Cm --quiet .
.It Fl w Ar whitelist , Cm --whitelist Ar whitelist
The
.Ar whitelist
is the package manifest.
The most basic version contains the list of files within the
.Ar root-dir
that are to be packaged.
If this file is not provided, all files contained in the
.Ar root-dir
will be packaged.

.Sh METADATA FORMAT
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxx
.It Cm namebase Ar pkg-namebase
This entry sets the package's namebase to
.Ar pkg-name .
Among other things, this name is used - with the subpackage, variant,
and version of the concerned package - to identify a dependency.
.It Cm subpackage Ar pkg-subpackage
This entry sets the package's subpackage to
.Ar pkg-subpackage .
This is the second part of the package name
triplet along with the namebase and the variant.
.It Cm variant Ar pkg-variant
This entry sets the package's variant to
.Ar pkg-variant .
This is the third part of the package name
triplet along with the namebase and the subpackage.
.It Cm version Ar pkg-version
This entry sets the package's version to
.Ar pkg-version .
.It Cm comment Ar comment-string
.Ar comment-string
is a one-line description of this package.
.It Cm desc Ar description
.Ar description
is a much longer description of the package than the comment.
It may vary in length from one line to a few paragraphs.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
desc = <<EOD
   This is a longer description of the package.
   It can span multiple lines.

   It can also span multiple paragraphs.
EOD
.Ed
.It Cm www Ar url
The software's official website.
.It Cm maintainer Ar mail-address
The maintainer's mail address.
.It Cm prefix Ar path-prefix
The path where the files contained in this package are installed
.Pq usually Pa /raven .
This field is automatically inserted in the metadata if it doesn't
already exist.
The best practice is to omit this field.
.It Cm flatsize Ar size
The size that the files contained in this package will occupy on your system
once uncompressed.
This value does not take into account files stored in the
package database, nor does it account the space needed to support the
directory and file entities.
This field is automatically generated during package creation, so do not
provide it.
.It Cm abi Ar abi
This value is inserted into the metadata automatically so do not define it.
The
.Ar abi
is tuplet representing the operating system, the major OS release and
the architecture to indicate what for which system the package is intended.
.It Cm deps Ar dep-name dep-origin dep-version
Associative array of package dependencies, keyed on
.Ar dep-name
and with values
.Cm version Ar dep-version
and
.Cm origin Ar dep-origin .
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
deps: {
   pstree: {
      version: "2.36"
      origin: "pstree:standard"
   }
   cdiff: {
      version: "0.9.6.20140711,1"
      origin: "cdiff:standard"
   }
}
.Ed
.It Cm options Ar ucl-object
This field is of type ucl-object.
Each element contains a name-value pair.
The
.Ar name
is the option-name and the
.Ar value
is the option-value (e.g. ON/OFF, True/False).
.It Cm categories Ar array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a string which represents the category of
the package, e.g. math, graphics, french, etc.
.It Cm licenselogic Ar logic
This field is an enumeration.
The allowed values are
.Ar dual ,
.Ar multi ,
and
.Ar single .
.It Cm licenses Ar array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a string which represents the license
of the package, e.g. MIT, BSD3CLAUSE, APACHE20, etc.
.It Cm annotations Ar ucl-object
This field is of type ucl-object.
Each element contains a name-value pair.
The
.Ar name
is the key for defined annotation and the
.Ar value
is the actual note.
.It Cm users Ar array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a string which represents a user that
the package requires.
.It Cm groups Ar array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a string which represents a group that
the package requires.
.It Cm shlibs_provided Ar Array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a string which represents dynamically
linked library (the ELF SONAME) that is contained in the package.
This array is generated by
.Nm
and thus should not be provided.
.It Cm shlibs_required Ar Array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a string which represents a library
featuring an ELF SONAME definition that packages binaries are
linked with.
Each element is unique as the library is only listed once regardless
if multiple files are linked to it.
This array is generated by
.Nm
and thus should not be provided.
.It Cm shlibs_adjacent Ar Array
Each element of the array is a string which represents a library featuring an
ELF SONAME definition that are not packaged, but are present in the same
stage directory.
These libraries are most likely featured in a different subpackage, so a
missing library notice for these files should not be emitted during packaging.
This array is generated by
.Nm
and thus should not be provided.
.It Cm scripts Ar ucl-object
This field is of type ucl-object.
Each element contains a name-value pair.
The
.Ar name
is an enumeration of pre-install, post-install, pre-deinstall, post-deinstall,
pre-install-lua, post-install-lua, pre-deinstall-lua, post-deinstall-lua.
The
.Ar value
is an array which contains strings of scripts to be executated at the
indicated package phase.
.It Cm directories Ar Array
This field is of type array.
Each element of the array is a ucl-object to describe empty directories
that must be created and destroyed during package operations.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
directories: [
  {
    group: false
    owner: false
    path: 'share/fonts/nicefont'
    perms: false
  }
  {
    group: false
    owner: false
    path: 'share/theora/data'
    perms: 2413
  }
]
.Ed
This field is created automatically from whitelist keywords and thus
should not be provided.
.El
.Sh WHITELIST FORMAT
The following describes the whitelist format:
.Pp
The whitelist is a sequential list of lines which can have keywords prepended.
A keyword starts with an
.Sq @ .
Lines not starting with a keyword are considered as paths to a file.
If started with a
.Sq /
then it is considered an absolute path.
Otherwise the file is considered as relative to
.Ev prefix .
.Pp
Keyword lines are formed as follows:
.Ar @keyword
.Ar line
.Pp
Available keywords are the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Cm @comment Ar string
The line will be ignored when packing.
.It Cm @(x,y,z) Ar (owner, group, mode) path
This keyword sets any combination of ownership, group member,
and permission modes for the given file, but at least one of them
must be defined.
These values override the attributes of the file.
An alternative to using this keyword is having the port set them
directly in the stage directory.
.It Cm @dir Ar path
Declare directory
.Pa path
to be created at install time and attempt to delete it at deinstall time.
By default, most directories created by a package installation are
deleted automatically when the package is deinstalled, so this directive is
only needed for empty directories or directories outside of
.Ev prefix .
.It Cm @dir(x,y,z) Ar (owner, group, mode) path
This is similar to
.Pa @dir
but it sets the attributes of the directory after its creation.
.It Cm @keyword arg1 arg2
All other
.Pa keyword
actions are defined in files named
.Pa <keyword>.ucl
located in the keywords directory defined in the configuration.
