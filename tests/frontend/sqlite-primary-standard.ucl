SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library. Programs that link the
SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate
RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone command-line
access program (sqlite3) that can be used to administer an SQLite database
and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.
